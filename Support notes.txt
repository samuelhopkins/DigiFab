Support system
Compound shape doesn't need supports, is assumed to be stable...
	compound shape doesn't appear to be a mix of a cube, sphere and cylinder but...OK

for every facet with a surface normal with a negative z-component (facing downward)
	vet the angle betweent the surface normal and cutting plane
		both normal and cutting plane can be represented as Vertices
		cutting plane: 100,100,0
	this formula requires:
		math (for trig functions)
		dot product function
		magnitude function
	check the resultant angle between planes against the minimum support angle
		Cura's support angle treats vertical as 0, horizontal as 90
		this is the equivalent of (90 - theta)
	Is the resultant angle >= min support angle?
	NO - no support; break
	YES: 
		find the center of that face
			take midpts in x,y,z
		Support class
			Vertex(x,y,z) for x,y, target z
			where target z is the mdpt z of the target face
Once all supports are created,
	join supports by common x/y-value (doesn't matter which, as long as it's consistent)
	separate by a support-infill% (just like in the regular infill% spacer)
	remove any and all supports that are not part of these support lines
	form a perimeter out of all the points at the ends of the lines
		this will serve as the outermost support
			the edge for both the brim and rafting areas
Brim: Print x brim layers from (thickness * x) away, work way in to widest perimeter of the shape
	Print a grid-line across the area denoted by the outermost support perimeter(1st layer)


Rafting: set initial area to that of the brim width, x layers out (just a single layer though)
	print rows from edge to edge based on support-infill% 
	fill in this space for several layers (use existing grid fill with 50% infill)
	then start 

Support:
	run check across each Support in a given line
		if the current height of the Support == target height, don't print there
			isntead find the next line in the current Support[] line that has not reached the target height
		if not, do print there, increment current height by layer height
	this will continue for every layer until the end
